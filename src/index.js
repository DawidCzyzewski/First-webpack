// Firstly I created folders dist (and index.html in it - in this folder will be bundled code) and src (with index.js - here will be our source files). Next I've inictialized npm package.json (command npm init in terminal).
// Secondly I installed webpack and webpack-client in devDependencies(command npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev).
// Next step was to delate "main": index.js, in package.json and to add "private": true in this line. It helps us not to public our library by accident.
